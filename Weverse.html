              <p>Weverse, marketed as a solution to language barriers between Korean artists and fans, disappoints users

                <b>hit-or-miss translation feature</b>. Despite restricting posts and comments to community members,
                <b>online
                  harassment persists</b>, lacking the expected positivity that would differentiate Weverse from other
                social media
                platforms. Moreover, <b>low fan-to-fan engagement causes users to swiftly check in on artists and exit
                  the app</b>.
                <br><br>
                My objective was to research, strategize, and <b>design an experience that provides accurate
                  translations, decreases
                  online harassment, and increases fan-to-fan engagement</b> making Weverse the must-have app for fans.

                a single dollar
                on user research, it’d be well-informed. And that’s why I decided to analyze 249 of Weverse’s top Apple
                app store
                reviews. To my surprise, <b>reducing harassment was the most suggested feedback, followed by separating

Also, I don't really understand the subscribing thing. If I subscribe to another fan, do their posts pop up in my feed more often?''
                        
                        User 2 rated it 1 star and wrote 'The Translation is so wrong. It would be nice if it could be corrected.'
                        
                        User 3 rated it 1 star and wrote 'Poorly moderated, racist users. Not only is this app poorly moderated, but the amount of reports I've done to the racist users who have said things to me as a black person on that app so far.

                        User 4 rated it 5 stars and wrote 'I think this app is pretty cool and helps communicate from fan to artist pretty well, though I'd love for a feature that would allow live streams as well as professional translators'
                        
                        A bar chart of the most suggested improvements from reviews is then displayed. The following data is ordered from most suggested to least suggested:

              - get replied from my favourite artists 
              - connect with other fans 
              - post interesting content to get engagement
              
              Constraints:
              - my posts get buried by other posts
              - other user posts aren't interesting enough for me to befriend them
              - I don't know what to post, and posting feels pointless anyway

              Motivations:
              - forming connections with fans and bonding over their shared interests
              - interacting with, and showing support for, my favourite artists

              Frustrations: 
              - seeing hateful posts towards artists in their own communities
              - rarely getting replies or cheers (likes)

              Says:
              - I'll never get noticed by my favourite artist
              - I have no idea what this translation means

              Thinks:
              - Weverse should be my safe space to be a fan
              - This feed is so boring. It's just a bunch of spam

              Does:
              - translations are so poor I have to switch to Twitter to see fan translations
              - spends a long time sifting through notifications because it's overwhelming

              Feels: 
              - ignored by both artists and other users
              - confused by the interface 
              - overhwlmed by irrelevant content">

            Quad 1: 
            High impact, low effort means these goals are great
            Reduce harassment, Improve engagement, Make UI more usable and intuitive


            Quad 2: 
            High impact, high effort means these goals are good 
            Personalize feed, Improve translations, Improve notifications

                Before: Users were confused about how to switch between communities because the dropdown button looked
                like a
                verification checkmark. In addition, the profile pictures incorrectly implied users could click into
                individual artist
                profiles.
                <br><br>The UI of artist moments (stories) at the top of the community feed had text that was hard to
                read since they
                were on top of images, and the rectangle images didn't give users a good idea of what they'd be clicking
                into. Artist
                moments were also redundantly repeated in a different UI on the artist feed.
                <br><br>After: An image banner replaces the confusing multiple profile pictures, and one profile picture
                containing an
                artist’s logo is used to afford switching between artist communities.  
                <br><br>Only 16% of users reported using the Discover page often, so I removed it from the main
                navigation and placed a
                global community search at the top instead.
                <br><br>Artist moments only live on the artist feeds as it makes more sense there and allows room for
                the poll on the
                community feed. The UI was changed for better readibility and clarity.

                Before: There was no search functionality so users had to horizontally scroll through 30+ community

                <br><br>
                After: Users can filter between Korean and International artist communities, and search for specific
                names using the
                search bar.

              <p>
                Before: Whenever artists go on a reply spree, their notifications get lost among personal activity
                notifications. As we
                know, users mainly check Weverse to see artist posts and interactions with other users.


                <br><br>
                After: I separated the notifications into Artist and My Activity. Only 12% of users reported joining
                more than 7
                communities, so it isn't overwhelming to filter by community.

                Since this was my first ever product design project, I failed to consider some factors. If I
                could redo the
                usability tests, I would include a Net Promoter Score, instead of asking open ended questions to measure
                how much they
                liked the new features. In future projects, to have a clearer, and more quantifiable result of user
                experiences, I would
                choose an appropriate metric in the testing phase.
